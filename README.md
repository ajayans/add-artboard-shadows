A sketch plugin that makes your user flows look better, by adding more contrast between the artboards and background.



## Why this plugin?
- We sometimes need to share user flows as static images or docs (as opposed to prototypes).
- So we create a slice around a sequence of artboards, and export that slice.
- Sketch `doesn't retain the artboard shadows` that you see on the editor, when you export them.
- As a result your artboards are sometimes `hard to distinguish` from the background.

## Installation
With Sketch Runner, just go to the `install` command and search for `Add Shadows to Artboards`. Runner allows you to manage plugins and do much more to speed up your workflow in Sketch. [Download Runner here](http://www.sketchrunner.com).
